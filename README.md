# 09 Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Your Task

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions&mdash;this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

Your task is to 

> **TO-DO**create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). 


> **TO-DO** Review the [Professional README Guide](https:ls
//coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) as a reminder of everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 


> **TO-DO**Invoke the application by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```




 Because this application won’t be deployed, 
 
 
 > **TO-DO** You’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. 
 
 
 > **TO-DO** Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. 
 
 
 > **TO-DO** You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.


## User Story

```md

> **TO-DO** Title displays as the title of the README


> **TO-DO** Enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions


> **TO-DO** Add the information to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests


> **TO-DO** Choose a license for my application from a list of options


> **TO-DO** Add a badge for that license near the top of the README and add a notice to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under


> **TO-DO** Enter my GitHub username


> **TO-DO** Add Github username to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile

> **TO-DO** Click on the links in the Table of Contents


> **TO-DO** Take user to the corresponding section of the README
```

## Getting Started

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

> **TO-DO**Create a `.gitignore` file


> **TO-DO**include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. 


> **TO-DO** Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.


> **TO-DO** Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. 


> **TO-DO**Create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.


> **TO-DO** Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.


> **TO-DO** Refer to the [Fullstack Blog Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for additional guidance on creating a video.

> **TO-DO** Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.


## Grading Requirements


> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria: 

### Deliverables: 20%

> **TO-DO** A sample README generated using the application must be submitted.


> **TO-DO**Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 27%

> **TO-DO** A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the README generator 



> **TO-DO** Add walkthrough video and a link to read.me and submit on osu site.


> **TO-DO** The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.


> **TO-DO** The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.


> **TO-DO** The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated README that matches the user input and has a functioning table of contents.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:


> **TO-DO**Use the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).


### Repository Quality: 13%

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:


> **TO-DO** A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application.
